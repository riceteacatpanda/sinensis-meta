**Dev.to - Rust or Go for web development?**

> Rust is a good fit for computationally intense, high throughput situations, but will require higher cognitive overhead to put together. Golang is a language designed from the ground up to target this space, but also with an emphasis on large scale collaboration. [...] The standard library has a great story for webdev baked in, though, and will likely be a more frictionless experience end to end.

**kristoff.it - Why Go and not Rust?**

> Go takes great pride in offering a limited set of features built-in the language. This makes Go easy to learn and, even more importantly, it ensures that Go projects remain understandable even when growing in size.

> Goâ€™s concurrency model is a good fit for server-side applications that must primarily handle multiple independent requests, rather than participate in complex result-passing schemes.
